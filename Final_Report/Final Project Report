## **Introduction**

The evolution of the entertainment industry, fueled by the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, has drastically changed content production and consumption patterns. As competition intensifies, understanding the financial performance of movies becomes essential for optimizing content strategies and investment decisions.
This project, titled "Netflix Movie Performance Analytics (2010–2025)," aims to provide data-driven insights into the factors influencing movie success on Netflix.
By leveraging a cleaned Netflix movie dataset integrated with metadata fields such as budget, revenue, genre, popularity, and ROI (Return on Investment), we seek to uncover patterns that can guide future production, marketing, and release strategies for streaming content.

## Research Question and Approach

### Research Question
> **What factors contribute most significantly to the financial success of Netflix movies between 2010 and 2025, and how can these insights inform strategic content decisions?**

More specifically:
- How do genre, budget, and popularity correlate with ROI?
- Are there specific release years or trends that impacted movie profitability?
- Which countries and genres consistently yield higher returns?

### Approach
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Merged Netflix movie datasets with external metadata sources (e.g., TMDb).
   - Cleaned and standardized fields including budget, revenue, genres, production countries, release year, popularity, and computed fields like ROI and profit.

2. **Data Storage and Querying:**
   - Uploaded the cleaned dataset into **Google BigQuery**.
   - Defined clear schema with appropriate data types for efficient querying.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed SQL-based exploratory queries to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
   - Focused on genre distribution, ROI patterns, popularity impact, and country-based performance.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Built dynamic, interactive dashboards using **Grafana**.
   - Created panels showing key metrics like:
     - Total number of movies
     - ROI trends over time
     - Genre-based revenue efficiency
     - Popularity vs ROI
     - Hidden gem identification (low popularity, high ROI)

5. **Insight Generation:**
   - Interpreted visualizations to generate business insights.
   - Highlighted strategic patterns such as optimal genres, timing for releases, and high-efficiency production regions.

# **Introduction of the Dataset**

The dataset captures Netflix movie performance data from 2010 to 2025, including title, genres, country, language, release year, vote count, popularity, budget, revenue, ROI, profit, and efficiency. The data was cleaned using Python and enriched through TMDb API calls. This enabled a comprehensive analysis of financial trends, genre success, and viewer engagement signals.

# **Dataset**:

![ Dataset used ](NETFLIX_ANALYSIS/dashboard_screenshots/dataset_screenshot/screenshot_2025-04-26_015236.png)

# **Literature Review**

Research shows genre choice, localization strategies, and viewer engagement metrics are critical for success. Documentary and Music genres often outperform mainstream genres in ROI. Language localization (French, Spanish, Japanese) improves ROI. Viewer behavior signals like votes and popularity align moderately with profitability but are not direct predictors (Statista, 2024; Ying et al., 2023; Smith et al., 2023).


# **Financial Constraints and Adoption Challenges**

- **High Content Production Costs**: Significant upfront investments are required without guaranteed returns.
- **Market Competition**: Bidding wars for premium content inflate costs.
- **Localization Barriers**: Additional costs for language and cultural customization.
- **Viewer Churn Risk**: Risk of subscription cancellations if content quality dips.

Financial discipline and selective investment are critical.

 **Digital Transformation and Strategic Implementation**

- **Data-Driven Content Decisions**
- **Automated Infrastructure**
- **Strategic Localization**
- **Agile Strategic Shifts**

Digital transformation integrates analytics into every stage of content lifecycle management.

 **ROI Measurement and Sustainable Growth**

- **Cost per Viewing Hour (CPVH)**
- **Lifetime Value of Subscribers (LTV)**
- **ROI Beyond Revenue**
- **Sustainability Strategies**

Sustainable growth requires a multidimensional ROI perspective.

# **Descriptive methodology of Project:**
 
 The dataset was cleaned and enriched to ensure analytical accuracy and completeness.
Key steps included:

**Python-Based Cleaning:**
Duplicate records were removed, missing values were imputed, and inconsistent language and country fields were standardized using Python automation scripts.

**TMDb API Enrichment:**
Missing metadata such as budget, revenue, genres, and vote counts were retrieved via TMDb API calls, enhancing the dataset's depth and reliability.

**Feature Engineering:**
New calculated fields — ROI, Profit, and Efficiency — were introduced to better measure financial performance beyond basic revenue numbers.

**Dataset Finalization**:
After cleaning and enrichment, a refined dataset of 15,485 Netflix movies spanning 2010 to 2025 was created, ready for visualization, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.

This methodological approach enabled a detailed, reliable exploration of financial trends, genre-specific success patterns, and viewer engagement signals critical for strategic insights.

# Popularity vs ROI Correlation

## Overview
This panel analyzes the relationship between a movie’s **popularity score** and its **Return on Investment (ROI)**.  
Each dot on the scatter plot represents a movie, plotted based on its popularity (x-axis) and ROI (y-axis).

---

## Key Insights
- **Weak correlation observed:**  
  The scatter plot shows that **high popularity does not consistently lead to high ROI**. Many movies with **low to moderate popularity** still achieve **very strong ROI**.
  
- **Outliers:**  
  - A few titles have extremely high ROI despite relatively low popularity scores.
  - Some highly popular movies have modest ROI, indicating that **popularity alone isn't a reliable predictor of profitability**.

- **Distribution:**  
  - Most movies are clustered at lower popularity and ROI values.
  - There is a wide vertical spread at low popularity scores, suggesting that **good ROI can happen without major popularity**.

- **Strategic Implication:**  
  - Netflix and content producers should **focus more on content quality, cost control, and niche audience targeting** rather than purely chasing hype.
  - **Data-driven greenlighting strategies** could lead to higher investment success compared to hype-driven ones.

---

## Interpretation
- **Hype ≠ Profit:**  
  While a movie may generate significant public attention, that doesn't guarantee it will be financially efficient.

- **Investment Prioritization:**  
  Netflix
